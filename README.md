# xenonStack
just for my task internship for company placements

i used some help from stack overflow for various commands usage.

i made a bash file named sysopctl with an extension .sh

i gave it version v0.1.0 as asked in the task by using this -> VERSION="v0.1.0"

  then i made a help function to display users various help command's.

  u need to first install git to use it in windows, as i don't have linux i used git or my windows os.

  start git and make sure to change the current directory to where the sysopctl.sh file is stored.

  then give execute permission by chmod +x /path/to/sysopctl.sh

  now u can use these commands 

  first run this command ./sysopctl.sh --help

  now various usable commands will be displayed run them by using this format -> ./sysopctl.sh command_name
