# xenonStack
for my task internship for company placements

i used some help from stack overflow for various commands usage.

i made a bash file named sysopctl with an extension .sh

i gave it version v0.1.0 as asked in the task by using this -> VERSION="v0.1.0"

  then i made a help function to display users various help command's.

  u need to first install git to use it in windows, as i don't have linux i used git or my windows os.

  start git and make sure to change the current directory to where the sysopctl.sh file is stored.

  then give execute permission by chmod +x /path/to/sysopctl.sh

  now u can use these commands 

  first run this command ./sysopctl.sh --help

  now various usable commands will be displayed run them by using this format -> ./sysopctl.sh command_name

for this i used html css and javascript to create webpages

used javascript to switch between sections to make a beautiful switch system where tabs switch between lands, apartments and houses.

used firebase's authentication system like createUserWithEmailAndPassword and signInWithEmailAndPassword to create sign_up and sign_in functionality.

used css to create a beautiful webpage where corners are filled with shadows to create an amazing view, i did it by putting background image in lower z-axis and shadow in upper z-axis to make it look like there is a dark shadow above it.

used some free stock image's to create this astonishing website.

then i used netlify to host the website
